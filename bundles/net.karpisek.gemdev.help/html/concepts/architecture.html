<h1>Communication with GemStone/S</h1>

GemDev plugin does not use any of usual solutions for connecting to GemStone database (no GemBuilder).<br>

Instead it uses topaz script in combination with HTTP and custom&nbsp;message format.<br>

<br>

Life cycle:<br>

<ol>

  <li>broker server&nbsp; is started and listens on one port for incoming http request</li>

  <li>eclipse&nbsp;connects to broker server and asks it for new
GemStone sessions (currently each GemDev project uses 2 GemStone
sessions in parallel)</li>

  <li>broker server checks if there is enough free ports which can be
used for communication (for each gemstone session there has to be one
port)</li>

  <li>broker server executes topaz script which starts&nbsp;new http server listening on port assigned to this particular session</li>

  <li>after all sessions are created and their session servers started confirmation is returned to eclipse client</li>

  <li>from that point&nbsp;eclipse client&nbsp;always communicates directly with sessions (broker server is not used)</li>

  <li>when user disconnects the project, Eclipse closes all gemstone sessions it was using</li>

</ol>
