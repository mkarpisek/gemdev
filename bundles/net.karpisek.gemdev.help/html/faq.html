<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h4>Q: Can I have smalltalk workspace?</h4>

A: .Yes. Just create in your GemDev project file with .gsw extension.
Eclipse will use (by default) Workspace Editor which provides most of
Smalltalk functionality. If this project will be connected to database
it will be possible to use hyper linking, search in database&nbsp;and
other features which needs connection to database,.<br>

Alternatively you can use evaluation panel in Inspector view.<br>
<h4>Q: Can I use plugin in Eclipse on Linux?</h4>
A: Yes. Not much tested as it is not my main platform, but it is possible (checked on&nbsp;Ubuntu 9.10 with Eclipse 3.5)
