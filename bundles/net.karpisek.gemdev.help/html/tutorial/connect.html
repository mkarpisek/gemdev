<h1>Connecting to Database</h1>





After you&nbsp;<a href="install.html">installed GemStone and started Broker Server</a> and <a href="new-project.html">Created GemDev Project</a>&nbsp; you can connect with Eclipse to database.<br>





<br>





Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">GemDev project</span> you want to connect to database and in context menu choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Connect</span> action <br>





(menu item <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disconnect</span> disconnects connected projects from database)<br>


<br>





<img style="width: 415px; height: 336px;" alt="" src="../../images/ConnectAction.gif"><br>





<br>





In case you connect first time to GemStone Eclipse will ask for you
initials (initials are used by GemStone for method timestamps)<br>


<br>

<br>





Finally Eclipse will ask broker server for GemStone sessions it can use
and caches essential information about database (this can take longer
time in case you are connecting&nbsp;big database and/or you have slow network connection)<br>
